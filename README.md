### **<u>Identification of the *problem* you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace *app*.</u>**

During the pandemic, people took to their kitchens and asserted their ingenuity and new found love for cooking by sharing their masterpieces in the name of food. With that brave goal in my mind my marketplace application was born, for people to share their home cooked food to others, in the name of sharing, learning and of course cooking. This application as much of a marketplace it is, was essentially made to return the costs of labour and costs back to the chef, allowing people all over Australia to indulge in the brilliance of others and not have to source fast food and other delicacies while we are all in lockdown. Hopefully this allows people to get into their kitchens more and enjoy the brilliance that is home cooked food, whether frozen for convenience or ready on pickup. 

### **<u>Why is it a *problem* that needs solving?</u>**

My marketplace aims to serve people respectively in their local community by allowing people near them to gain access to food they would not usually have, allows individuals to do something with their time, especially during a pandemic and also lessens the burden of big grocery shops and their food wastage. These are all relevant problems when thought about individually as firstly, you allow people to be productive and serve their local community by allowing others serve culturally significant dishes or whatever interests they have in cooking. This also allows people in the community to access such food at reasonable prices, without having to go to restaurants (especially when you cannot like during a pandemic), or trying to make it themselves. People in the community also get paid for their efforts which may be a reasonable source of income. Secondly food wastage amongst leading grocery stores in Australia is extremely large, and is estimated to be around $20 billion dollars each year. Amongst this food wastage, over 710. 000 people rely on food services to gain access to eating alone in Australia at reasonable prices, making it hugely insecure commodity. Companies like Ozharvest have tried to mitigate all of these costs, but there is still a great deal more work to do. If a sharing economy for food did exist, I personally think not only would this strengthen communities especially in tougher times, but also serve the environment, food wastage and the vastly insecure population of people who cannot access wholesome homecooked food in many areas.

1. The purpose of this application was to build a marketplace application in accordance with the designated criteria, and my own expectations of what I could personally achieve in the time. Given the knowledge I have acquired in the last 8 weeks of studying rails application development, I set myself a goal of not only focusing on the marking criteria as this is the reality of programming and application development but to further understand the obscurities that can only be developed when practical work is committed by yourself rather than theory. Furthermore my application idea I think has real world application and was practical in its purpose to achieve its goals stated above. 
2. The functionality and features of my application include, a web based application that users can interact with that allows users to create listings of food items they make and sell them in their respective states. Users can browse listings and also purchase any given listings with the implementation of Stripe payment. Additional features of my website include being able to track your listings, and browse your sell and purchase history on your profile. Features in the application itself included many gems including devise, which was vital to all of the validation of users, postgres which allowed me to track my database and link primary/foreign keys and AWS for image upload capabilities.
